## Scope of functionalities and limitations

This app allows two players to play a game of chess on a single desktop. Both players have the option to turn on/off easy mode, which will show available moves when a piece is selected. Pawns can be promoted when they reach the other side of the board, but no other advanced play moves can be made. The game will highlight when a player is in check and will not allow them to make an illegal move. It will also automatically end the game when a player is in check mate.

## Future Improvements

- Add in advanced play moves (castling & en pessant)
- Make it suitable for mobile devices
- Make it playable by two players across a network
- Allow a game to be saved mid-way through
- Stop players being able to accidentally refresh the page without having to confirm
